*beacon.txt*  See your cursor jump

INTRODUCTION                                    *beacon*

Whenever cursor jumps some distance or moves between windows, it will flash so
you can see where it is. This plugin is heavily inspired by emacs package
beacon.

Note: this plugin only works in neovim.

OPTIONS                                         *beacon-option*
    
    g:beacon_size                               *g:beacon_size*
        Change beacon size. Default 40.

    g:beacon_show_jumps                         *g:beacon_show_jumps*
        Show beacon, when cursor jumps inside window. Default 1.

    g:beacon_minimal_jump                       *g:beacon_minimal_jump*
        Number of lines that considered a jump. Default 10.

    g:beacon_shrink                             *g:beacon_shrink*
        Shrinking animation of beacon. Default 1.

    g:beacon_fade                               *g:beacon_fade*
        Fading animation of beacon. Default 1. 
        Note: You should set |g:beacon_timeout| to some number of milliseconds
        (somewhere around 300-500 is nice), otherwise beacon wont be cleared.

    g:beacon_timeout                            *g:beacon_timeout*
        Delay before hiding beacon in milliseconds. Default is not set, it is
        just fades out until it's gone.

CHANGE COLOR                                    *hl-Beacon*

Beacon is highlighted by `Beacon` group, so you can change it like this:
>
    highlight Beacon guibg=white ctermbg=15
<
use |guibg| if you have |termguicolors| enabled, otherwise use |ctermbg|.
